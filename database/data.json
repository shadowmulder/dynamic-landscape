      "description": "AWS IoT SiteWise is a managed service that makes it easy to collect and organize data from industrial equipment at scale. You can easily monitor equipment across your industrial facilities to identify waste, such as breakdown of equipment and processes, production inefficiencies, and defects in products. Today, getting performance metrics from industrial equipment is tough because data is often locked into proprietary on-premises data stores and typically requires specialized expertise to retrieve it and put it in a format that is useful for searching and analysis. IoT SiteWise simplifies this process by providing software running on a gateway that resides in your facilities and automates the process of collecting and organizing industrial equipment data. This gateway securely connects to your on-premises data servers, collects data, and sends the data to the AWS Cloud. You can run the IoT SiteWise software on an AWS Snowball Edge gateway or install the IoT SiteWise software on popular third-party industrial gateways. These gateways are specifically designed for industrial environments that are likely already in your facilities connecting your industrial equipment.  You can use IoT SiteWise to monitor operations across facilities, quickly compute common industrial performance metrics, and build applications to analyze industrial equipment data, prevent costly equipment issues, and reduce production inefficiencies. With IoT SiteWise, you can focus on understanding and optimizing your operations, rather than building costly in-house data collection and management applications. ",

AWS SSO also includes built-in SAML integrations to many business applications, such as Salesforce, Box, and Office 365. Further, by using the AWS SSO application configuration wizard, you can create Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 integrations and extend SSO access to any of your SAML-enabled applications. Your users simply sign in to a user portal with credentials they configure in AWS SSO or using their existing corporate credentials to access all their assigned accounts and applications from one place.",

      "description":"Cloud Security Scanner is a web security scanner for common\n            vulnerabilities in Google App Engine applications. It can automatically scan and detect\n            four common vulnerabilities, including cross-site-scripting (XSS), Flash injection,\n            mixed content (HTTP in HTTPS), and outdated/insecure libraries. It enables early\n            identification and delivers very low false positive rates. You can easily setup, run,\n            schedule, and manage security scans and it is free for Google Cloud Platform users.",

GCP\u2019s Cloud Audit Logs already provide visibility\n            into the actions of your own administrators. However, this audit trail typically\n            stops once your cloud provider\u2019s support or engineering team is engaged. For example,\n            prior to Access Transparency logging, if you opened a ticket with Google Support\n            that would require data access, it would not have been reflected in a Cloud Audit\n            Log. Access Transparency closes that gap, capturing near real-time logs of manual,\n            targeted accesses by either support or engineering.",
